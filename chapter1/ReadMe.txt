To demonstrate what is the basic purpose for APIs
-------------------------------------------------

Our purpose is:
1. Routing
2. CRUD Operation

Kind of Life cycle:
    1. Listening to port
    2. Understand the http request and package the info in an object

For this creating a API in node.. (Without any .net framework)
    1. npm init (from command prompt run as administrator)
    2. Follow the instructions
    3. Add a start script: "nodemon app.js"
        app.js will be the entry point.
    4. Use express to define certain endpoints.
    5. npm install express nodemon



Key Notes:
1. Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
